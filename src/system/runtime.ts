 * Per-Durable-Object runtime holder.

 * The old Express backend was a long-lived process with a filesystem and a
 * global WebSocket manager. On the Worker, all of that now lives inside a
 * single `SystemState` Durable Object instance. Because a DO is a single
 * isolate with exactly one live instance, a module-level singleton set in
 * the DO constructor is safe and lets the ported services keep almost the
 * same shape they had against `node:fs` — they just read `rt().store`
 * instead of reading files.
